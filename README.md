### 1. Overview

- This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a simple encryption technique also known as the Shift Cipher. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This shift value is known as the "offset" or "key."

- The purpose of this project is to provide a basic implementation of the Caesar Cipher for educational and demonstration purposes. It includes functions to encode and decode messages using the Caesar Cipher with a given offset.

### 2. Project Description
- The Cipher project is a scientific repository designed to assist scientists and researchers in securely storing confidential information. Using the [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) encryption algorithm, the project allows for the encoding and decoding of messages in a simple and efficient manner, ensuring the protection of sensitive data.

* Features
Message Encoding: Users can input their confidential information into the repository and encrypt it using the Caesar Cipher with an offset of their choice.

* Message Decoding: The project also enables users to decode previously encrypted messages, using the same offset used for encoding.

* User-Friendly Interface: Cipher has a user-friendly and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to interact with and utilize.

####       General Information: 

 In this project, I created my first web application during the bootcamp. In this application, the user can encrypt and decrypt a text in the browser by providing a specific character shift (offset).

I worked based on a boilerplate, which provided the basic structure of the project with different folders (using JS modules).

### 4. Learning Objectives

- I learned about code maintenance and improvement tools (linters and unit tests).
I gained knowledge about objects, data structures, methods, and iteration (loops) in JavaScript.
I implemented version control using git (and the GitHub platform).

- This project was based on a prototype, which was changed over the course of the project. ** This project was developed individually and completed in 3 Sprints. **

### 5. Final Project

- In this web application, users can use the Caesar Cipher technique to encrypt and decrypt messages with a given offset. It's a simple yet educational project that allows me to apply the concepts I learned during the bootcamp in a practical way.
